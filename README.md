## Introduction
Disciplined is a designed software that allows to time-control, organize tasks, measure time spent on tasks, organize the system of work, among others. I develop it for myself - because I want to organize myself as well, alongside the purpose of having a portfolio element. Disciplined is run on console (command prompt; terminal) and is using ***ncurses*** as a UI engine - run on the console. It also connects to a website where you can measure your productivity, stored in a disk and able to be shown in clear diagrams.

The program is available under MIT License, which means you can take it, edit, modify, redistribute as you wish.

### The General Knowledge of Studying and working
Disciplined is not only a terminal - website project, it also collects information about efficient studying & working, based on the neuroscientific, psychological (among others) knowledge. You can contribute to this database of knowledge - the project is on open source.

### Compilation under linux

---

```bash
cd Disciplined/
mkdir build/
cd build/
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" ../
make -j2
```

---

### Limitations

Disciplined will not replace writing by pen, or offline tools one can use to discipline oneself. Therefore, you must consider this tool as an sentient interface between you and your computer, and if you wish to do task swiftly, rather than by deliberate, slow, aware action taking. You can use Disciplined as a already-working, enough-tool for your discipline tasks.
