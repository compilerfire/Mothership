# Disciplined
## Introduction
Disciplined is a designed software that allows to time-control, organize tasks, measure time spent on tasks, organize the system of work, among others. I develop it for myself - because I want to organize myself as well, alongside the purpose of having a portfolio element. Disciplined is run on console (command prompt; terminal) and is using ***ncurses*** as a UI engine - run on the console. It also connects to a website where you can measure your productivity, stored in a disk and able to be shown in clear diagrams.

The program is available under MIT License, which means you can take it, edit, modify, redistribute as you wish.

### The General Knowledge of Studying and working
Disciplined is not only a terminal - website project, it also collects information about efficient studying & working, based on the neuroscientific, psychological (among others) knowledge. You can contribute to this database of knowledge - the project is on open source.
